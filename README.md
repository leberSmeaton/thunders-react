# Thunders _Weather_ React App

_Thunder aka 'Thundercat' is my 'son', who is a cat and I dedicate this app to him_

Thunders Weather React App is a final installment of the SheCodes project bundle.
I have steadily built this app alongside the SheCodes Plus React workshop since the start of 2021.  
This is still a work in progress as my next step is making it responsive.

I would say I am still struggling with applying useStates at this point but I am looking forward to working more with React to become more familiar.
